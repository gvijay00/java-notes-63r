#  Java Abstract Class


## 🔹 1. What is an Abstract Class?

An `abstract class` in Java is a **special class** that:

* Cannot be instantiated (no objects can be created directly)
* Can contain:

  * **Abstract methods** (no body)
  * **Concrete methods** (with body)
  * Variables (static/final/instance)
  * Constructors

It's used to **provide partial implementation** and define a **common base for subclasses**.

## 🔹 2. Syntax

```java
abstract class ClassName {
    abstract void method1();   // Abstract method
    void method2() {           // Concrete method
        System.out.println("Concrete method");
    }
}
```

## 🔹 3. Key Features

| Feature              | Abstract Class Support    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Instantiation        | ❌ Not allowed directly    |
| Abstract methods     | ✅ Optional                |
| Concrete methods     | ✅ Yes                     |
| Constructor          | ✅ Yes                     |
| Fields (variables)   | ✅ Instance, static, final |
| Inheritance          | ✅ via `extends`           |
| Static/final methods | ✅ Allowed (not abstract)  |



### Key Rules for Abstract Classes:

1. Declared using the `abstract` keyword
2. Cannot be instantiated directly (cannot use `new Vehicle()`)
3. May contain both abstract and concrete methods
4. Abstract methods must be declared with the `abstract` keyword and have no body
5. If a class contains even one abstract method, the class must be declared abstract
6. Subclasses must implement all abstract methods or be declared abstract themselves
7. Can have constructors (even though you can't instantiate the class directly)
8. Can have fields, static methods, and instance methods with implementation
9. Can extend another class (abstract or concrete)

## 🔹 4. Design Principle (Important!)

> ✅ **If a class contains only static methods or static fields, declare it as `abstract`  to prevent object creation.**

### ✅ Example:

```java
abstract class MathUtils {
    public static final double PI = 3.14;

    public static int square(int n) {
        return n * n;
    }
}
```

> This ensures the utility class is not instantiated accidentally.

## 🔹 5. When to Use Abstract Classes?

* When you want to **provide a base class** with **some common implementation**
* When some methods must be **implemented by subclasses**
* When you want to **restrict object creation**

## 🔹 6. Abstract Class vs Interface

| Feature              | Abstract Class      | Interface                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Methods              | Abstract + Concrete | All abstract (Java 7), default/static (Java 8+) |
| Variables            | Any type            | Only `public static final`                      |
| Constructor          | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No                                            |
| Multiple Inheritance | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes (Multiple interfaces)                     |
| Inheritance keyword  | `extends`           | `implements`                                    |

## 🔹 7. Example: Abstract Class in Action

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();

    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.makeSound(); // Bark
        a.eat();       // This animal eats food
    }
}
```

---

## 🔹 8. Abstract Class with Constructor

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    Vehicle() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle created");
    }

    abstract void run();
}

class Bike extends Vehicle {
    Bike() {
        super(); // Calls Vehicle's constructor
    }

    void run() {
        System.out.println("Bike is running");
    }
}
```

---

## 🔹 9. Abstract Class with Variables

```java
abstract class Shape {
    final double PI = 3.14; // final field
    int side = 5;           // instance variable

    abstract double area();
}
```
