# Access Modifiers in Java 
 
Access modifiers define the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables in Java.

### 1. Types of Access Modifiers
- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere (inside and outside the package).
- **Private**: Accessible only within the same class.
- **Default (Package-private)**: If no modifier is specified, the member is accessible only within the same package.
- **Protected**: Accessible within the same package and subclasses (even if they are in different packages).

###  Access Modifiers for Top-Level Classes
- Only **public** and **default** are allowed for top-level classes.
- **private** and **protected** are not allowed for top-level classes.

# **Classification of Keywords in Java**

Java keywords are reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language.

### 1. Java Keywords 
These are the core reserved words used in Java programming. They serve various functions such as defining data types, control flow, exception handling, etc.

### 2. Literals in Java 
Literals are predefined constant values in Java that are not considered keywords but have a special meaning.

### 3. Reserved Words for Future Use 
These words are reserved by Java but are not yet implemented or used.

# **Identifiers in Java**

Identifiers are names given to variables, methods, classes, and interfaces in Java.

### Rules for Identifiers
- Can contain letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), underscore (_), and dollar sign ($).
- Cannot start with a digit (e.g., `1variable` is invalid).
- Cannot be a Java keyword (e.g., `int`, `class`, `void` cannot be used as an identifier).
- Case-sensitive (`Variable` and `variable` are different).
- No special characters except `_` and `$` are allowed.
- Can be of any length, but meaningful names are recommended.

#### Examples
```java
int age;       // Valid
int _count;    // Valid
int $salary;   // Valid
int 1number;   // Invalid
int class;     // Invalid (class is a keyword)
```

# **Naming Conventions in Java**

Naming conventions improve code readability and maintainability.

### 1. Class and Interface Names
- Use **PascalCase** (each word starts with a capital letter).
- **Examples**: `StudentDetails`, `BankAccount`, `EmployeeRecord`.

### 2. Variable and Method Names
- Use **camelCase** (first word is lowercase, subsequent words start with uppercase).
- **Examples**: `studentName`, `calculateSalary()`.

### 3. Constant Names
- Use **UPPER_CASE** with underscores (_).
- **Examples**: `PI`, `MAX_VALUE`, `MIN_BALANCE`.

### 4. Package Names
- Use all lowercase letters, usually in reverse domain name format.
- **Examples**: `com.example.project`, `org.company.module`.
