### **`this()` vs `super()` in Java:**

| Feature                     | **`this()`**                                        | **`super()`**                                      |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                 | Refers to the current instance of the class.        | Refers to the parent class (superclass) of the current class. |
| **Usage in Constructors**  | Used to call another constructor in the same class. | Used to call a constructor in the superclass.       |
| **Position in Constructor** | Must be the **first statement** in the constructor. | Must be the **first statement** in the constructor. |
| **Class**                   | Can only be used within the **same class**.          | Can only be used in a **subclass** to call a parent class constructor. |
| **Behavior**                | If used, it calls another constructor in the same class, either default or parameterized. | If used, it calls the parent class constructor, and if no constructor is explicitly called, the parent classâ€™s default constructor is called automatically. |
| **Access to Parent Class**  | Cannot directly access parent class methods or fields. | Used to access methods or constructors from the parent class. |
| **Constructor Chaining**    | Used for chaining constructors within the same class. | Used for chaining constructors from the parent class. |
| **Multiple Calls**          | Can only call one constructor of the same class (`this()`), but you can pass different parameters to it. | Can only call one constructor of the parent class (`super()`), but you can call different parent constructors with various parameters. |

### **Key Differences Between `this()` and `super()`**

1. **`this()`** is used to call a constructor of the **same class**, while **`super()`** is used to call a constructor of the **parent class**.
2. **`this()`** is used for **constructor chaining within the current class**, whereas **`super()`** is used for **constructor chaining to the parent class**.
3. Both **`this()`** and **`super()`** must be the **first statement** inside the constructor, meaning you can't have any other code before them.
4. **`this()`** calls a constructor with the same name (from the current class), while **`super()`** calls the constructor of the **parent class**.

### **Example:**

```java
class Parent {
    Parent() {
        System.out.println("Parent Constructor");
    }
    
    Parent(String msg) {
        System.out.println("Parent Constructor with message: " + msg);
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
        // Calling Parent's default constructor
        super();  
        System.out.println("Child Constructor");
    }
    
    Child(String msg) {
        // Calling Parent's parameterized constructor
        super(msg); 
        System.out.println("Child Constructor with message: " + msg);
    }
}

class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Creating Child object with default constructor:");
        Child c1 = new Child();
        
        System.out.println("\nCreating Child object with parameterized constructor:");
        Child c2 = new Child("Hello from Child");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Creating Child object with default constructor:
Parent Constructor
Child Constructor

Creating Child object with parameterized constructor:
Parent Constructor with message: Hello from Child
Child Constructor with message: Hello from Child
```

In this example:
- **`super()`** is used to invoke the parent class's constructor, either the default or parameterized.
- **`this()`** could have been used in the **Child class** to call a different constructor within the **Child class** itself (though we didn't use it here).

### **When to Use `this()` vs `super()`?**

- Use **`this()`** when you need to call another constructor of the **current class** (usually for constructor chaining within the same class).
- Use **`super()`** when you need to call a constructor from the **parent class** (usually for constructor chaining from the parent class).
