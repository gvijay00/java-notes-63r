# Introduction to Java
 
## 1. History of Java
Java was developed by **James Gosling** and his team at **Sun Microsystems** in 1991. Initially, it was called **Oak**, but it was later renamed to **Java** in 1995. The language was designed to be **platform-independent** and was initially used for **embedded systems**. Sun Microsystems publicly released Java in **1995**.

In **2010**, **Oracle Corporation** acquired Sun Microsystems, making **Java an Oracle product**. Over the years, Java has evolved through multiple versions, introducing new features and improvements with each update.

## 2. Introduction to Java
Java is a **high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent** programming language. It follows the **WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere)** principle, utilizing the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** to run programs on any platform without modification.

### Key Aspects of Java:
- Used in **web development, mobile applications, enterprise applications, and embedded systems**.
- Designed to be **simple, secure, and robust**, with **automatic memory management**.
- Java code is first **compiled into bytecode**, which is executed by the **JVM**, making it independent of the underlying operating system.
  

## 3. Features of Java
Java is a powerful and versatile language that offers several essential features:

1. **Platform Independence** – Java programs run on any system that has a **JVM**.
2. **Object-Oriented** – Follows **OOP principles** such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
3. **Simple and Easy to Learn** – Java has a clean syntax, similar to **C++**, but without complexities like pointers.
4. **Robust and Secure** – Provides features like **exception handling and a security manager** to prevent unauthorized access.
5. **Automatic Memory Management** – Uses **Garbage Collection** to efficiently manage memory.
6. **Multithreading** – Supports **concurrent execution** of multiple threads for improved performance.
7. **High Performance** – Utilizes **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation** for optimization.
8. **Distributed Computing** – Java provides APIs like **RMI (Remote Method Invocation)** for network-based applications.
9. **Rich API** – Offers a vast collection of **built-in libraries** for various functionalities.
10. **Community Support** – Has a large and active **developer community** that continuously enhances Java.

## 4. Editions of Java
Java has evolved into different editions, each designed for specific application domains:

### 1. Java Standard Edition (Java SE)
- The **core Java platform** used for **general-purpose programming**.
- Includes essential libraries like **collections, threading, networking, and JDBC**.
- Used for **desktop applications, command-line tools, and basic server-side applications**.

### 2. Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) *(Now Jakarta EE)*
- Designed for **large-scale, enterprise-level applications**.
- Includes APIs for **web services, servlets, JSP, EJB, JPA, and more**.
- Used for building **distributed, scalable, and secure web applications**.

### 3. Java Micro Edition (Java ME)
- A lightweight version of Java for **mobile and embedded systems**.
- Used in **IoT devices, smart cards, and feature phones**.
- Contains a subset of Java SE with **optimizations for constrained environments**.

### 4. JavaFX
- A modern **UI framework** for building **rich internet applications (RIA)**.
- Replaces **Swing and AWT** for creating **desktop applications with advanced UI features**.
- Supports **CSS, FXML**, and integrates with **web technologies**.
