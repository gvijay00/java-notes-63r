# Static Methods in Java 

## What are Static Methods?
Static methods in Java are methods that belong to the class rather than instances of the class. They are declared using the `static` keyword and can be called without creating an instance of the class.

## Declaration of Static Methods
A static method is defined using the `static` keyword before the return type:

```java
class Example {
    static void displayMessage() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }
}
```

### How to Call Static Methods?
Since static methods belong to the class, they can be called using the class name:

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example.displayMessage(); // Calling static method using class name
    }
}
```

## Characteristics of Static Methods
1. **Belong to Class:** Static methods are associated with the class itself rather than any specific object.
2. **Can Access Static Members Only:** Static methods can only access static variables and other static methods directly.
3. **Cannot Use `this` or `super`:** Static methods cannot refer to instance variables or methods using `this` or `super`.
4. **Improves Memory Efficiency:** Since static methods do not require object instantiation, they help optimize memory usage.
5. **Shared Among All Instances:** A static method can be accessed by all instances of the class without duplication.

## Example: Static Method Usage
```java
class MathOperations {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = MathOperations.add(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Addition Result: " + result);
    }
}
```

## Accessing Static Methods Within the Same Class
If the static method is within the same class, it can be called directly without using the class name:

```java
class Sample {
    static void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello, Welcome!");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        greet(); // Directly calling static method
    }
}
```

## **Three Ways to Access Static Members in Java:**
1. **Using the Class Name** (Recommended)
   ```java
   Example.display(); // Accessing using class name
   ```

2. **Using an Object (Not Recommended but Possible)**
   ```java
   Example obj = new Example();
   obj.display(); // Warning: Should be accessed using class name
   ```

3. **Calling Directly (Within the Same Class)**
   ```java
   display(); // Direct call within the same class
   ```

### **Best Practice:**
- Always use **ClassName.methodName()** to call static methods.
- Avoid using objects to access static methods.
- Within the same class, direct calls are acceptable.

## Restrictions of Static Methods
1. **Cannot Access Instance Members:** Static methods cannot access instance variables or instance methods directly.
2. **Cannot Override in Subclasses:** Static methods cannot be overridden but can be hidden if redefined in a subclass.
3. **Cannot Use `this` or `super`:** As static methods are not tied to an object, they cannot use `this` or `super` keywords.

### Example: Attempting to Access Instance Members in Static Method (Error)
```java
class Demo {
    int x = 10;
    
    static void show() {
        // System.out.println(x); // Compilation Error: Cannot access instance variable in static method
    }
}
```

## When to Use Static Methods?
- When a method does not depend on instance variables.
- For utility or helper methods (e.g., `Math.sqrt()`, `Collections.sort()`).
- When a function performs an independent operation (e.g., database connection utility methods).

## Summary
- Static methods belong to the class, not instances.
- They can be called using the class name.
- They can access only static members.
- They cannot use `this` or `super`.
- They cannot be overridden but can be hidden in subclasses.
- Best suited for utility functions and independent operations.
