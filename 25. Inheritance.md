#  Inheritance in Java 

## 1. What is Inheritance?

- Inheritance is one of the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
- In Java, **Inheritance** means **one class (child class) acquiring the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent class)**.
- It helps in **code reusability** and **method overriding**.

---

## 2. Syntax of Inheritance

```java
class Parent {
    // fields and methods
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // fields and methods
}
```

Here, `Child` class **inherits** from `Parent` class using the **extends** keyword.

## 3. Types of Inheritance in Java

| Type | Description |
|:--|:--|
| Single Inheritance | One class inherits from one other class |
| Multilevel Inheritance | Class inherits from a child class (chain-like) |
| Hierarchical Inheritance | Multiple classes inherit from a single parent |
| Multiple Inheritance | One class inherits from multiple classes (Not supported via classes) |
| Hybrid Inheritance | Combination of two or more types (Handled using interfaces) |

---

## 4. Single Inheritance

One child class inherits from one parent class.
One child class inherits from one parent class.
![single level](https://www.trytoprogram.com/images/single-inheritance.jpg "single level")

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats food");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

 `Dog` inherits `eat()` method from `Animal`.

---

## 5. Multilevel Inheritance

One class inherits from a class which itself is inherited from another class.

![multi level](https://www.trytoprogram.com/images/multi-level-inheritance.jpg "multi level")

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats food");
    }
}

class Mammal extends Animal {
    void walk() {
        System.out.println("Mammal walks");
    }
}

class Dog extends Mammal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

 `Dog` indirectly inherits `eat()` and `walk()` methods.

---

## 6. Hierarchical Inheritance

Multiple child classes inherit from one parent class.
![heirarchical-inheritance](https://www.trytoprogram.com/images/heirarchical-inheritance.jpg "heirarchical-inheritance.")

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats food");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}
```

 Both `Dog` and `Cat` inherit `eat()` from `Animal`.

---

## 7. Multiple Inheritance (Classes)

- Java **does not support multiple inheritance with classes** to **avoid ambiguity problems** (known as the **Diamond Problem**).
- **Multiple Inheritance** means a class trying to inherit from **more than one class**.

Example that is **NOT allowed** in Java:

```java
class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("A's show");
    }
}

class B {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("B's show");
    }
}

// This is NOT allowed
class C extends A, B {   // Error: Class cannot extend multiple classes
    // Ambiguity: Which show() to inherit?
}
```

### ❌ Result:
- Java compiler will throw an error:  
  `Class C cannot extend multiple classes`

---

#  Diamond Problem in Java

## What is the Diamond Problem?

- It happens when **one class inherits from two classes that have a common superclass**.
- The **problem is ambiguity**:  
  If two parent classes have the **same method**, and a child class inherits both,  
  then **which method should the child inherit**?
  
### Classic Diamond Shape Diagram:

```
      A
     / \
    B   C
     \ /
      D
```

Where:
- Class B and Class C inherit from A
- Class D tries to inherit from both B and C

 Problem: If A, B, and C all have a method `display()`, and D inherits from both B and C,  
**then which `display()` should D inherit?** B's or C's?  
→ **AMBIGUITY!**

---

## Why Java does not allow Multiple Inheritance using Classes?

- **To avoid ambiguity** at runtime and compile time.
- **Simplify the design** — no confusion about which method to inherit.
- **Prevent complexity** — keeps Java simple and easy to understand.

---

## Interfaces and Multiple Inheritance

 Java solves this problem using **interfaces**.

In **interfaces**, even if two interfaces have the same method signature, the implementing class **must override** the method and provide its own definition — so **no ambiguity**.

---

## Final Conclusion:

| Situation | Java Behavior |
|:---|:---|
| Multiple Inheritance using Classes | ❌ Not allowed (to prevent Diamond Problem) |
| Multiple Inheritance using Interfaces | ✅ Allowed (child must override methods) |

---

#  Important Keywords:

| Keyword | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `extends` | Used for class inheritance |
| `implements` | Used for interface inheritance |
| `super` | To call parent class constructor/method |
| `this` | Current object reference |

---

#  Quick Summary (Important Points)

- Java supports **single, multilevel, and hierarchical** inheritance via classes.
- Java **does not** support **multiple inheritance via classes** to avoid **Diamond Problem**.
- Java **supports** multiple inheritance **via interfaces**.
- **Private** members of the parent are **not inherited**.
- **Constructors** are **not inherited**, but the child can call them using `super()`.
