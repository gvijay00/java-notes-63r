#  Has-A Relationship in Java (Composition vs Aggregation)

In Java, a **Has-A relationship** means that **one class contains a reference to another class** as a field or member variable. Itâ€™s used to achieve **code reusability** through object composition.

---

##  1. **Composition**

###  Definition:

> Composition is a strong **Has-A relationship** where the containing class **owns** the object it contains.
> If the container is destroyed, so are the contained objects.

###  Example: `Person` has-a `Heart`

```java
class Heart {
    void beat() {
        System.out.println("Heart is beating...");
    }
}

class Person {
    private Heart heart = new Heart(); // Strong Has-A

    void live() {
        heart.beat();
        System.out.println("Person is alive.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person();
        p.live();
    }
}
```

###  Key Points:

* Object (`Heart`) is **created inside** the `Person` class.
* Tight coupling.
* If `Person` is deleted, the `Heart` also gets deleted.

##  2. **Aggregation**

###  Definition:

> Aggregation is a **weaker Has-A relationship**, where one class **uses** or **refers** to another class, but **does not own** it.
> The contained object can exist independently.

### ðŸ”¹ Example: `School` has-a `Student`

```java
class Student {
    String name;

    Student(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    void show() {
        System.out.println("Student: " + name);
    }
}

class School {
    Student student; // Weak Has-A

    School(Student student) {
        this.student = student;
    }

    void showStudent() {
        student.show();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student("Rahul");
        School sch = new School(s);
        sch.showStudent();
    }
}
```

###  Key Points:

* Object (`Student`) is **passed from outside**.
* Loose coupling.
* If `School` is destroyed, `Student` can still exist independently.
